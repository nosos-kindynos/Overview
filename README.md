# Overview

This project is completely open source and we look forward to considering your suggestions about any error we might have overlooked or any logical fallacy we might have not been able to figure out , or even a scope for improvement as a user's actions and judgements concerning their own safety might use these statistics as a dominant parameter and giving them inaccurate results might lead to a compromise of their safety , contradicting the whole intention of this project.

This project is just a prototype and has not been designed to fully  be put to mass use , but rather to just convey an idea , which we hope can provide an incentive in the development of further ideas thus progressing society as a whole.


# Disease Risk Estimation

Infectious disease transmission risk estimation by modelling disease transmission dynamics through user updated social interactions.

This project is designed for estimating risks based on social connections assumming relatively simple and ideal one to one transmission dynamics with the hope that the necessarry protocols such as hygiene,social distancing, wearing surgical face masks, etc. are being followed and may not be capable of analysing large social gatherings or physical contacts where transmission dynamics get more advanced and relitively chaotic , making parameters assumed insignificant here dominant enough to produce a significantly different result ,  thus require more advanced and sophesticated methods.

It cannot take action, all it can do is give people information with the hope that they will take the right necessarry actions,as people should know what they are dealing with.


With all good hope, we wish that it can make some difference and avoid something unwanted from happening.


# Modelling Transmission Dynamics

This project models transmission dynamics based on user updated social relationships. We are assumming ideal transmission modes which take place when in the viscinity of an infectious person , hence based on the social interaction we assign the relationship a one on one tranfer chance , which is the probability of the transfer of the disease to the other if one happens to posses it.

The one one one tranfer chance is calculated by assigning the relationship a tranfer factor , which is the ratio of the one on one transfer chance of this relationship to the average one one one trnasfer chnace of a particular diease , also referred to as the reproduction number (R0) in epidemology.
